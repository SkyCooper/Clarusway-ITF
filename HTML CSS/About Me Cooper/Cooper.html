    </div>

    <p id="info"> I graduated with distinction from Mechanical Engineering (Bachelor of Science) with a GPA of 3.65/4. In my early professional career, I led teams of more than 50 professionals at various levels. Later on, I earned my MA in International Relations and Leadership with a GPA of 91.2/100. <br> <br>
        As a team or workgroup leader, I participated in over 1000 exercises, meetings, seminars, courses, and workshops in international organizations. I worked on operations planning-execution-monitoring-control tasks and actively took part in working groups to produce lessons learned and solution suggestions. In these processes, I used and managed IT tools and decision support systems. I participated in the software development processes of these decision support systems as an R&D team leader. <br>
        <br>
        As a General Manager, I have managed the venture founding process for Carians Bistro in the chocolate sector and Mymodon in the furniture sector in the USA, Europe, and UK markets and other processes such as brand creation, development, supply chain management, digital advertising, and marketing, selling on e-commerce platforms, customer relations, and green logistics.
        As the General Manager of another medical startup, I also managed the finance, procurement and downstream supply chain processes of medical devices, tools, equipment, and medical consumables for hospital projects in Central Asian countries.
        <br> <br>
        I have successfully completed intermediate level courses on Computer Fundamentals, Computational Thinking, Network Basics, Python, Git/GitHub, SQL, HTML, CSS, Linux, SDCL/DevOps, Agile, Jira at Clarusway, a US-based software training institute.
        I still continue my studies on Data Science and aspire to work on Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.</p> <br> <br>
